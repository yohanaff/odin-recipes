				<li>Pinch of salt</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Steps</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Combine all the ingredients in the food processor</li>
				<li>Pulse-stopping every now and then to open and stir until the mixture is fine and resembles wet sand (be careful not to overdo it, or you'll end up with peanut butter)</li>

                <li>Carefully unmold, using your fingers to help each paçoca push through the cookie cutter</li>
